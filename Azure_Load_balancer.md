# Learned a simple setup of Azure Load Balancer 

## What is Azure Load Balancer?

Azure Load Balancer is a highly available, fully managed service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend resources such as Virtual Machines (VMs) within Azure. It operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model, enabling it to handle both TCP and UDP traffic. The key goals are high availability, scalability, and resilienceâ€”ensuring that applications remain responsive and reliable even under heavy load or when individual backend servers fail.

## Key Features:

- Distributes inbound and outbound network traffic

- Supports both public (Internet-facing) and internal (private) traffic scenarios

- Provides health probes to monitor backend resource status

- Offers port forwarding and outbound NAT functionality

- Scales to millions of flows for all TCP/UDP applications

- Integration with other Azure services and security models

## Types of Azure Load Balancer

- Public - Distribute Internet traffic to VMs - Internet-facing
- Internal - (Private)	Distribute traffic within a Virtual Network (VNet) - Private only

There are also Basic and Standard SKUs, with Standard offering more features, reliability, and integration options
